# Alex Anonymous - nwhacks2024
- Hackathon Project (Navid, Max, Robin, Eden)

## Inspiration
We were inspired by the problem of addicts not having extended support after their programs.
## What it does
Provides an aware chat-bot to talk with about your addictions. The bot is aware of your progress and remembers your goals.
## How we built it
Swift, Flask, ElevenLabs, OpenAI
## Challenges we ran into
Fine-tuning GPT was quite difficult. We went through many different iterations of training until we were happy with the results
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our instance of GPT is highly specialized and conversational (unlike stock GPT)
## What we learned
Working with AI APIs (ElevenLabs, GPT, Whisper); communicating with our own web server
## What's next for Alex Anonymous
Location-based features, long-term chatbot memory of conversations
